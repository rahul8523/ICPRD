                review of recent developments in bilateral trade and investment
                ties and acknowledged the vast untapped potential for further
                expansion. To this effect, both sides identified several areas
                of focus for enhancing both bilateral trade as well as mutually
                beneficial investments. These include resolving market access
                issues of both sides and cooperation in key sectors such as
                Crude oil and Natural Gas, Pharmaceuticals, Unified Payments
                Interface (UPI), Local Currency Settlement System, Power Sector

                sides actively engaged in the proceedings of the JTC. The
                discussions were held in a cordial and friendly atmosphere and
                were fruitful. There was an enthusiastic response towards
                greater cooperation, addressing pending issues, boosting trade
                and investment, and greater people-to-people contacts.
              </p>

              <p>

                committed to expeditiously addressing all issues impeding
                bilateral trade and facilitating trade promotion between the two
                nations. A business delegation led by CII also accompanied the
                official delegation comprising representatives from various
                sectors like power, fintech, telecommunications, electrical
                machinery, pharmaceuticals, etc. The deliberations of the 2nd

                indicative of the amicable and special relations between the two
                countries.
