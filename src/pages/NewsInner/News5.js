                01 MAY 2024: The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government
                of India, through the National Centre for Polar and Ocean
                Research (NCPOR), will host the 46th Antarctic Treaty
                Consultative Meeting (ATCM 46) and the 26th Meeting of the
                Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP 26) from May 20 to
                30, 2024, in Kochi, Kerala. This aligns with India’s poise to
                facilitate constructive global dialogue on environmental
                stewardship, scientific collaboration, and cooperation in
                Antarctica.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ATCM and meetings of the CEP are pivotal in the
                international community's ongoing efforts to safeguard
                Antarctica's fragile ecosystem and promote scientific research
                in the region. Convened annually under the Antarctic Treaty
                System, these meetings serve as forums for Antarctic Treaty
                Consultative Parties and other stakeholders to address
                Antarctica's pressing environmental, scientific, and governance
                issues. The Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959 and entered into
                force in 1961, established Antarctica as a region dedicated to
                peaceful purposes, scientific cooperation, and environmental
                protection. Over the years, the Treaty has garnered widespread
                support, with 56 countries currently party to it. The CEP was
                established under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to
                the Antarctic Treaty (the Madrid Protocol) in 1991. The CEP
                advises the ATCM on environmental protection and conservation in
                Antarctica.
              </p>
              <p>
                India has been a Consultative Party to the Antarctic Treaty
                since 1983. It participates in the decision-making process along
                with the other 28 Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty
                to date. India’s first Antarctic research station, Dakshin
                Gangotri, was established in 1983. At present, India operates
                two year-round research stations: Maitri (1989) and Bharati
                (2012). The permanent research stations facilitate Indian
                Scientific Expeditions to Antarctica, which have been ongoing
                annually since 1981. In 2022, India enacted the Antarctic Act,
                reaffirming its commitment to the Antarctic Treaty.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty, India remains dedicated
                to environmental protection, scientific cooperation, and
                peaceful operations in Antarctica. Dr M Ravichandran, Secretary
                of the Ministry of Earth Sciences, highlighted the importance of
                India hosting the ATCM and CEP meetings in 2024. He said, “We
                look forward as a country to fostering meaningful exchanges of
                knowledge and expertise to advance the shared goals of
                environmental conservation and scientific research in the
                Antarctic region.”
              </p>

                The Antarctic Treaty Secretariat (ATS) serves as the
                administrative hub for the Antarctic Treaty System. Established
                in 2004, the ATS coordinates the ATCM and CEP meetings, reposits
                and disseminates information, and facilitates diplomatic
                communication, exchanges, and negotiations related to Antarctic
                governance and management. It also monitors compliance with
                Antarctic Treaty provisions and agreements and provides
                assistance and guidance to Antarctic Treaty Parties on treaty
                implementation and enforcement matters.
              </p>

              <p>
                Key items on the 46th ATCM agenda include strategic planning for
                sustainable management of Antarctica and its resources; policy,
                legal, and institutional operations; biodiversity prospecting;
                inspections and exchange of information and data; research,
                collaboration, capacity building and cooperation; addressing
                climate change impacts; development of tourism framework; and
                promoting awareness. Lectures of the Scientific Committee on
                Antarctic Research will also be conducted. The 26th CEP agenda
                focuses on Antarctic environment evaluation, impact assessment,
                management, and reporting; climate change response; area
                protection and management plans including marine spatial
                protection; and conservation of Antarctic biodiversity.
              </p>

              <p>
                The hosting of the 46th ATCM and 26th CEP meeting reflects
                India's growing role as a responsible global stakeholder in
                efforts to preserve Antarctica for future generations. Through
                open dialogue, collaboration, and consensus-building, India
                remains committed to upholding the principles of the Antarctic
                Treaty and contributing to the sustainable management of one of
                Earth's last pristine wilderness areas.
