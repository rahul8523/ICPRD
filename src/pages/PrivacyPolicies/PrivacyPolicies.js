          (2) We look to our readers to donate funds which enable us to continue
          our work. The “Donate” section is the gateway which allows you to
          contribute. We are conscious of the concerns of donors regarding the
          safeguarding of sensitive financial and personal information during
          the transaction. This policy sets out the system in place to ensure
          your security.

          • We will be issuing a receipt and 80G certificate against your
          deduction and must therefore collect your name, address, phone number,
          residence status, PAN Number and email address to dispatch an
          e-receipt and/or courier a hard copy. If you only want an e-receipt,
          you need not provide your mailing address and phone number. No hard
          copy will be issued, nor is it necessary to claim IT benefits. You may
          choose not to share your PAN Number. In such a case, CPAA will be
          required to pay income tax at current rates, normally 30% of donated
          amount.

          authorities in case of scrutiny.
