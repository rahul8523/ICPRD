                <b>Dear readers,</b>
                <br />
                <b>Namaste!</b>
                <br /><br />

                I am pleased to introduce to you, the "India Centre for Policy Research and Development (ICPRD)". We at ICPRD are committed to contributing to the process of nation-building and doing our best and more to build the 'New India' envisioned by our Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.
                <br /><br />

                The Prime Minister’s dream to usher India into a new era of peace, progress, and happiness for all can be realized only through relentless dedication to the noble mission defined by him.
                <br /><br />

                The ICPRD is geared up to work towards building a powerful nation with effective developmental policies and programmes. We propose to position ICPRD as one of the major think tanks dealing with contemporary national and international issues with due care, dedication, and urgency.
                <br /><br />

                ICPRD was formally launched in 2022. However, it did not come into being overnight. ICPRD, as a think-tank, was a dream for many of us like-minded individuals for many years. However, as we started working towards bringing this dream finally to shape, the COVID-19 Pandemic struck the world… We were hit by a pang of disappointment, and at one point in time thought that this project might never take off.
                <br /><br />

                But instead of giving in to the circumstances, we decided to fight against them with determination to succeed. Soon, I, and some of our team members were huddled in a room surrounded by dozens of books, researching, planning, and strategizing to form ICPRD. We spent days and months in that room, barely stepping out (as the country was in lockdown), pouring over books related to policies, politics, culture, ancient Indian scriptures, and more.
                <br /><br />

                As we read through some of the ancient scriptures, we finally found the foundation principles of the proposed organization. Our ancient wisdom has tenets like Yoga Kshema (well-being and prosperity of the community), Loka Sangraha (universal welfare and preserving societal order), and Labh Palana (secure socio-economic progress). These are the ideals needed today to guide us to overcome the challenges that threaten the very existence of human beings.
                <br /><br />

                We adopted these concepts as the core of ICPRD philosophy and finally, we had a strategy in place, and we knew what ICPRD would be all about. This is the brief story of the birth of ICPRD.
                <br /><br />

                We have now earnestly embarked upon our chosen path. ICPRD aspires to perform cutting-edge research and analysis to impact and raise public dialogue and awareness on significant areas that play a crucial role in the development of the country. The aim is to be able to help the government and decision makers in formulating policies directed towards mass welfare and the overall development of the country.
                <br /><br />

                The eight main domains that ICPRD focuses on include economic policy, international relations and foreign policy, climate change, food security, education and training, trade and commerce, rural urbanization, and agriculture.
                <br /><br />

                Today, I am happy to say that ICPRD is a sought-after institution for domain specialists and researchers who wish to address pressing issues facing Indian and global society through rigorous and fact-based analysis. We are actively engaged with experts and thinkers on the national and international fronts to facilitate the formulation of desired policies and support the holistic socio-economic development of the nation, thereby making India an economic powerhouse of the 21st century.
                <br /><br />

                ICPRD strives to contribute actively to empowering India to become a developed country and ‘Vishwa Guru’ (Global Leader) by 2047, as envisioned by our Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the architect of New India.
